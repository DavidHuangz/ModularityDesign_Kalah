##Measurements
#Metadata
CKCBO (Coupling)	UnboundedCount	(trgtdcl) Only record dependencies to target modules whose declarations have been seen; (srcsttc) Record dependencies with respect to both instance and static fields and methods in the source module; (trgtsttic) Record dependencies to both instance and static fields and methods in the target module; (srccons) Consider constructors as invokers as creating coupling; (trgtcons) Record both invoking methods and calling construtors as creating dependencies; (type) Record dependencies between all types, including interfaces, enums, an annotations; (anc) Include dependencies to ancestors of source; (desc) Include descendants to ancestors of source; (inh) Include dependencies on targets whose accessed members were inherited; (poly) Include dependencies on targets whose members were accessed via polymorphism; (bidir) Dependencies are recorded as bi-directional. If A has a dependency to B, then B has a dependency to A; (fanout) Record only dependencies from source to target (no-op when bidir); (mod) Record dependencies between modules (as opposed to between packages); (pres) Record only the presence (or not) of an occurrence of a dependency between entities; (nest) Consider nested or enclosing types are separate; (raw) Do not record dependencies due to synthetic constructs
WMC (Size)	UnboundedCount	(srcsttc) Record dependencies with respect to both instance and static fields and methods in the source module; (srccons) Consider constructors as invokers as creating coupling; (init) Record all dependencies including those in all initialisers; (raw) Do not record dependencies due to synthetic constructs; (srcmem) Include dependencies to members of all visibilities in source
NOC (Inheritance)	UnboundedCount	(srcsttc) Record dependencies with respect to both instance and static fields and methods in the source module; (srccons) Consider constructors as invokers as creating coupling; (init) Record all dependencies including those in all initialisers; (raw) Do not record dependencies due to synthetic constructs; (srcmem) Include dependencies to members of all visibilities in source
DIT (Inheritance)	UnboundedCount	(srcsttc) Record dependencies with respect to both instance and static fields and methods in the source module; (srccons) Consider constructors as invokers as creating coupling; (init) Record all dependencies including those in all initialisers; (raw) Do not record dependencies due to synthetic constructs; (srcmem) Include dependencies to members of all visibilities in source
LCOM2 (Cohesion)	UnboundedCount	(srcsttc) Record dependencies with respect to both instance and static fields and methods in the source module; (srcmeth) Do not consider constructors as invokers as creating coupling; (init) Record all dependencies including those in all initialisers; (srcmem) Include dependencies to members of all visibilities in source
RFC (Coupling)	UnboundedCount	(trgtall) Record dependencies to target modules whether or not the declarations have been seen; (srcsttc) Record dependencies with respect to both instance and static fields and methods in the source module; (trgtsttic) Record dependencies to both instance and static fields and methods in the target module; (trgtcons) Record both invoking methods and calling construtors as creating dependencies; (type) Record dependencies between all types, including interfaces, enums, an annotations
